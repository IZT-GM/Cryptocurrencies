# Cryptocurrencies Challenge

## Objective
Analyse a cryptocurrencies dataset, utilizing unsupervised machine learning model, to determine which cryptocurrency could be a good investment.

## Analysis
The data analysis was divided in four steps:
* Data Processing
	* Cryptocurrencies with non data were removed to improve the quality
* Principal Component Analysis
	* PCA algorithm was applied to reduce the dimensions of the DataFrame
* Clustering Data
	* KMeans algorithm was applied to determine the best k-value and separate the data into Classes.
* Visualizing
	* Utilizing 3D and 2D scatter plots were created to help on the data analyse.

## Conclusion
After the KMeans analysis, separating the dataset into 6 clusters seems reasonably well.
The clusters could be divided into:
* Low Supply, Low Mined
* Medium Supply, Low Mined
* High Supply, Low Mined
* Low Supply, High Mined
* Low Supply, High Mined
* Low Supply, High Mined
